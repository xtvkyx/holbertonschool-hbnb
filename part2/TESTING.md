## Testing Approach

Testing was performed using a black-box approach by validating endpoint behavior
against expected input/output formats and HTTP status codes. The API design was
reviewed using Swagger documentation generated by Flask-RESTx, and edge cases such
as missing fields and invalid data were considered during testing.
